  <h2>Mobile phone noise figure</h2>

  <div class="left_col">

    Before your phone (or mobile device) is anything else, it is a
    radio. Perhaps the most important parameter of a radio recevier is
    its [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_figure noise figure]. A
    low noise figure means less noise, and (roughly speaking) more
    bandwdith.

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    Below we show how the noise figure of various subsystems (blocks)
    can be combined to form an overall noise figure, and what that
    means in practice. A simple problem, but one considered routinely
    by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_engineering
    RF] engineers that designed your phone.

    The figure shows a simplified
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_front_end RF front end] of a
    mobile phone, comprising several blocks:
    <ul>
      <li>DUP: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplexer duplexer]</li>
      <li>LNA: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-noise_amplifier
      low-noise amplifier] </li>
      <li>ETC: Everthing else.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    Each block has a gain and a noise figure. The question is, given
    the specifications for each block, what is the overall noise
    figure for the receiver?

    The code below calls a function to repeatedly apply
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friis_formulas_for_noise, Friis
    formula] for two blocks. The function itself appears at the end.

    The output array is the <i>cumulative</i> noise figure looking
    into each block&mdash; so the total noise figure for the system
    (often called the "input referred" noise figure) is about 3.4 dB.

    We can learn quite a lot about RF design just by playing with the
    values above. Although very simple, the following observations
    dominate the RF design of mobile phones.

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    <ul>
      <li>The total NF is very sensitive to loss before the LNA. Try
      changing the duplexer gain and noise figure to -2 dB and 2 dB
      rspectively.</li>
      <li>The LNA is a <i>critical</i> block. Try chainging its gain
      and noise figure.</li>
      <li>The total noise figure is <b>far</b> less sensitive to the
      noise figure of blocks that follow the LNA. Try changing the
      noise figure of the ETC block.</li>
    </ul>
